        <h2>🌐 Networking Concepts Used</h2>
        <p>This website demonstrates the following secure networking principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ <strong>DNS:</strong> Resolves the domain <code>groupmeshtacular.github.io</code> to an IP address.</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>IP Address:</strong> The server is hosted on GitHub’s infrastructure (<code>185.199.108.153</code>).</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>HTTPS:</strong> Secure encryption enabled using GitHub’s SSL certificates.</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>HTTP Protocol:</strong> Requests are served using HTTP/HTTPS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Check the padlock icon in the address bar for a secure connection! 🔐</p>
